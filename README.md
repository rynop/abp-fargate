# abp-fargate

An [aws-blueprint](https://github.com/rynop/aws-blueprint) example for a ECS fargate based app, with or without an ELB

## Prerequisites

There are a handful of necessary steps prior to running any aws-blueprint enviornment. These only need to be done once.  You can find the instructions [here](https://github.com/rynop/aws-blueprint/blob/master/README.md#prerequisites).

## Setup

1. Run the setup script from your local git repo dir: 
    ```
    wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rynop/abp-fargate/master/bin/setup.sh; bash setup.sh; rm setup.sh
    ```

    This:
    *  Copies this code in this repo to yours
    *  Sets `NestedStacksS3Bucket` and s3 versions of your `nested-stacks` in your [vpc-ecs-cluster](./aws/cloudformation/vpc-ecs-cluster.yaml) and [aws-resources](./aws/cloudformation/aws-resources.yaml) .
1. Update the code to use your go package, by doing an extended find and replace of all occurances of `rynop/abp-fargate` with your golang package namespace.
1. Follow **Code Specifics** [below](https://github.com/rynop/abp-fargate#code-specifics)
1. Define **Environment variables** [below](https://github.com/rynop/abp-fargate#enviornment-variables)
1. Create an ECR [image repository](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-1#/repositories).  Naming convention `<git repo name>/<branch>`.

    Populate it with an inital image using your updated [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).  Here is an example using your git `master` branch (run from git repo root):
    ```
    awsCliProfileName=default
    gitRepoName=abp-fargate
    ecrRepositoryURI=11111.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/abp-fargate/master
    $(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region us-east-1 --profile $awsCliProfileName)
    docker build --build-arg CODE_PATH=cmd/example-webservices -t $gitRepoName/master:initial .
    docker tag $gitRepoName/master:initial $ecrRepositoryURI:initial
    docker push $ecrRepositoryURI:initial
    ```
1. **One time step**: Create ECS service linked role.  Only need to do this once per AWS account. 
    ```
    aws iam create-service-linked-role --aws-service-name ecs.amazonaws.com --profile
    ```
1. Create an ECS Cluster, follow **ECS Cluster Specifics** [below](https://github.com/rynop/abp-fargate#ecs-cluster-specifics).  Note: if you have multiple Docker services from multiple git repos, you may only have to do this one.  See below.
1. Create a Github user (acct will just be used to read repos for CI/CD), **give it read auth to your github repo**.  Create a personal access token for this user at https://github.com/settings/tokens.  This token will be used by the CI/CD to pull code.
1. Create a CloudFormation stack for your resources (dynamo,s3, etc).  You must also define an IAM role for your ECS tasks.  Use [./aws/cloudformation/app-resources.yaml](./aws/cloudformation/app-resources.yaml).  A stack for each of: `test`, `staging` and `prod`.  Naming convention `[stage]--[repo]--[branch]--[eyecatcher]--r`.  Ex `test--abp-fargate--master--imgManip--r`
1. Set stage specific parameters for each file in [./aws/cloudformation/parameters](./aws/cloudformation/parameters/).  The CI/CD (created below) will pass these params to [fargate-[with|no]-elb.yaml](./aws/cloudformation/) to create each stage's CloudFormation stack. Param `EcsCfClusterStackName` is the CloudFormation output value of `VpcEcsClusterStackName` from step 6 above.  You can delete the `-elb.yaml` file you don't need.
1. Create an SNS topic for CI/CD code promotion approvals. Topic name: `<git repo>-approval`. Subscribe your email address to it.
1. Use [cloudformation-test-staging-prod.yaml](https://github.com/rynop/aws-blueprint/blob/master/pipelines/cicd/cloudformation-test-staging-prod.yaml) to create a CodePipeline CI/CD that builds a docker image and updates ECS cluster with stage promotion approval. CloudFormation stack naming convention: `[repo]--[branch]--[service]--cicd`.  The pipeline will create a CloudFormation stack for each stage (`test`,`staging`,`prod`).
    1. Param `RelCloudFormationTemplatePath`: if your app needs an ELB specify [`aws/cloudformation/fargate-with-elb.yaml`](./aws/cloudformation/fargate-with-elb.yaml) otherwise, specify [`aws/cloudformation/fargate-no-elb.yaml`](./aws/cloudformation/fargate-no-elb.yaml). 
    1. If using `fargate-with-elb.yaml` your app **MUST**:
        * [accept health checks](./cmd/example-webservices/main.go#L29) at `/healthcheck`
        * [Verify](./pkg/serverhooks/main.go#L38) the value of the `X-From-CDN` header matches the value you set in the `VerifyFromCfHeaderVal` parameter in [`<stage>--ecs-codepipeline-parameters.json`](./aws/cloudformation/parameters/)
        * Edit your cloudfront > dist settings > change Security policy to `TLSv1.1_2016`.  CloudFormation does not support this parameter yet.
        * Create a DNS entry in route53 for production that consumers will use.  The cloud formation creates one for `prod--` but you do not want to use this as the CloudFormation can be deleted.
    1. Param `CodeEntryPointFilePath` is `cmd/example-webservices/main.go` for this example
    1. Param `RelDockerfilePath` is `Dockerfile` (it is at the root of this repo)
1. Make a source code change and `git push` to github. CodePipeline (CI/CD) will automatically run.  Once `test` stage is successfully executed (This will take 45 minutes on first deploy because CloudFormation initial creation), test sample code via:
    ```
    curl -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer aaa' -H 'X-FROM-CDN: [your X_FROM_CDN env value]' -d '{"term":"wahooo"}' https://[CloudFormation Output CNAME from test--[repo]--[branch]-[service]--fargagte]/com.rynop.twirpl.publicservices.Image/CreateGiphy
    ```        

### Enviornment variables

AWS Blueprint uses [Systems manager parameter store](https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/parameters) to define environment variables, using the namespace convention: 
```
/<stage>/<repoName>/<branch>/ecsEnvs/<env var name>
```
The `SsmEnvPrefix` parameter in `aws/cloudformation/parameters/*.json` defines this path.  [aws-env](https://github.com/Droplr/aws-env) is used to load the env vars from SSM into your container.  

`APP_STAGE` and `LISTEN_PORT` will automatically be set inside your container when running in ECS.

`X_FROM_CDN` is required if using an ELB - remember to do this for `staging` and `prod` stages too.

```
aws ssm put-parameter --name '/test/abp-fargate/master/ecsEnvs/X_FROM_CDN' --type 'String' --value 'fromCDN'
```

You can use [this helper script](https://github.com/rynop/aws-blueprint/blob/master/bin/fargate-ssm-env-var-helper.sh) to generate a bash script that will run the `aws ssm` commands for you.

### Code specifics

This example is using golang and the [Twirp RPC framework](https://github.com/twitchtv/twirp).  Project layout is based on [golang-standards/project-layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)

We recommend using [retool](https://github.com/twitchtv/retool) to manage your tools (like [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)).  Why?  If you work with anyone else on your project, and they have different versions of their tools, everything turns to shit.

1. Update [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile). Make sure to set `GITHUB_ORG`,`REPO`.  Also take a look at [.dockerignore](.dockerignore)
1. Update [./aws/codebuild/go-lint-test.yaml](./aws/codebuild/go-lint-test.yaml) to set your github org and repo (`GO_PKG`).
1.  Install [protoc](https://github.com/golang/protobuf), the protobuf compiler. You need version 3+.
1. [Install retool](https://github.com/twitchtv/retool#usage): `go get github.com/twitchtv/retool`. Make sure to add `$GOPATH/bin` to your PATH
1. Run:
    ```
    retool add github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep origin/master
    retool add golang.org/x/lint/golint origin/master
    retool add github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go origin/master
    retool add github.com/twitchtv/twirp/protoc-gen-twirp origin/v6_prerelease
    retool do dep init  #If this was existing code you'd run `retool do dep ensure`
    ```
1. Auto-generate the code:
    ```
    retool do protoc --proto_path=$GOPATH/src:. --twirp_out=. --go_out=. ./rpc/publicservices/service.proto 
    retool do protoc --proto_path=$GOPATH/src:. --twirp_out=. --go_out=. ./rpc/adminservices/service.proto 
    ```    
1. For this example, the interface implementations have been hand created in `pkg/`. Take a look.
1. Example to consume twirp API in this example: 
    ```
    curl -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer aaa' -H 'X-FROM-CDN: <your VerifyFromCfHeaderVal>' -d '{"term":"wahooo"}' https://<--r output CNAME>/com.rynop.twirpl.publicservices.Image/CreateGiphy
    ```
### ECS Cluster Specifics

Create an ECS cluster in its own VPC by using [./aws/cloudformation/vpc-ecs-cluster.yaml](./aws/cloudformation/vpc-ecs-cluster.yaml).  This cluster will run your `test`,`staging`,`prod` stages (task per stage). CloudFormation stack naming convention: `<eyeCatcher for logical grouping of applications>--ecs-cluster`. 

The naming convention here is a bit confusing, so let me explain a bit.  It is my intention to allow multiple Docker containers to run in one ECR cluster.  For example, if you are writing a blog platform you may have the following git repos - each with their own `Dockerfile`:

*  `internal-api`
*  `external-api`
*  `batch-processing`

This ECS cluster CloudFormation stack name could be: `blog-platform--ecs-cluster`. The 3 git repos above, would each follow the `abp-blueprint` steps in this readme EXCEPT for this step (creating the ECS cluster).  They would each have their own CI/CD, have their own ECS service and task(s).  However they would all run inside one ECS cluster.  The "magic" of this is done by setting the param `EcsCfClusterStackName` in . The value of `EcsCfClusterStackName` is the CloudFormation output value of `VpcEcsClusterStackName` from the ECS Cluster CloudFormation (`blog-platform--ecs-cluster` in this example).

It is up to you which git repo houses [./aws/cloudformation/vpc-ecs-cluster.yaml](./aws/cloudformation/vpc-ecs-cluster.yaml).

To summarize, my intention was to leave it up to the architect to determine if he/she wants multiple docker containers running in the same ECS or not.  You can absolutely run a `1:1` Docker (one git repo) container to ECS cluster - but it is not required.

## Testing locally:
1.  Set `LOCAL_LISTEN_PORT` and `X_FROM_CDN` env vars. (Fish: `set -gx LOCAL_LISTEN_PORT 8080; set -gx X_FROM_CDN localTest`)
1.  Build & run: `cd cmd/example-webservices; go run main.go`
1.  Hit endpoint: `curl -v -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer aaa' -H 'X-FROM-CDN: localTest' -d '{"term":"wahooo"}' http://localhost:8080/com.rynop.twirpl.publicservices.Image/CreateGiphy`


## Add dependency example: 
 ```
retool do dep ensure -add github.com/apex/gateway github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go
```

## Building docker image locally

```
docker build --build-arg CODE_PATH=cmd/example-webservices -t abp-fargate/master:initial .
```
